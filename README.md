Implement a design from scratch

In this project, we will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

We wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, we are free to implement it the way that we want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

The design is available on this webpage : https://www.figma.com/file/FfnVADRC9xgI3yiZliTBYZ/Holberton-School---Headphone-company?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=H5JebVNDcwPjFkxz-0
